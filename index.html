        <hr>
        <div class="header2">
          <p class="one"> Sebastian Allistaire Ravenwood III is a thirty-seven-year-old disabled military veteran. After serving his twelve years in the United States Marine Corps he was injured and honorably discharged. Needing a new career he fell back on to his favorite past time writing and telling stories. </p>
          <p class="one"> When he was five Sebastian's grandfather noticed he had a knack for telling creative stories to the family. He then taught him how to read and write. Before long Sebastian had devoured every book that his grandfather and mother had in their collection. And then he began writing down his own stories. </p>
          <p class="one"> Taking his G.I. Bill Sebastian used it to get his Bachelors of Fine Arts in Creative Writing for Entertainment from Full Sail University. And is presently in a Graduates program for Creative Writing at Southern New Hampshire University. </p>
          <p class="one"> Sebastian had taken a few courses and had a roommate that was a web developer so he is not new to the process. He even enjoyed doing it, which helped to keep his mind focussed. With the new economic climate, he figured why not get a degree or certificate in web development. This is why he came to Thinkful to start his training. </p>

        <hr>
        <div class="header3">
        <P class="two"> Transcending Reality Media is the brainchild of the founder and CEO Sebastian Allistaire Ravenwood III. It started as a way for him to present, market, and sell his books but it soon grew into something much more. A way for him to show off all of his skills. </P>
        <p class="two"> Starting out using WIX and Godaddy's website builders he began making sites for people. He was great at manipulating the systems to create beautiful and functioning websites but he was also limited. </p>
        <p class="two"> Transcending Reality Media is a young company but it has a lot of potential. There could be books, movies, video games, websites, writing classes, and many more things coming forth. All it needs is for its owner to receive the education and training needed to launch and a good supporting staff or benefactor (Partner). If you think you might be a good fit. Get in touch. </p>
